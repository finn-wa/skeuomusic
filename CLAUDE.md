# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A skeuomorphic Spotify music player web app styled after iOS 6's Music app, built with SolidJS and TanStack Start. Supports in-browser playback via the Spotify Web Playback SDK and remote control of other Spotify devices.

## Commands

Uses **Bun** as the package manager (not npm/pnpm).

```bash
bun run dev          # Start HTTPS dev server on localhost:3000
bun run build        # Vite build + TypeScript type-check (tsc --noEmit)
bun run test         # Run tests once with Vitest
bun run test-watch   # Vitest in watch mode
bun run test-ui      # Vitest with browser UI

# Linting & formatting via Biome
bunx biome check .
bunx biome check --write .
```

Run a single test file: `bun run test -- path/to/file.test.ts`

## Environment setup

Copy `.env.template` to `.env`. Required vars:
- `PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` — Spotify OAuth app client ID (exposed to client)
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` — Spotify OAuth secret (server-only)
- `SESSION_SECRET` — generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `HTTPS_CERT_PATH` / `HTTPS_KEY_PATH` — paths to self-signed certs in `cert/`

The dev server runs on HTTPS because Spotify's Web Playback SDK requires a secure context.

## Architecture

### Routing (TanStack Start, file-based)

`src/routes/` mirrors URL structure:
- `__root.tsx` — root layout, provides `AuthContext`
- `index.tsx` — login/landing page
- `music.tsx` — authenticated app shell; creates and provides `MusicContext` (playerStore + Spotify APIs)
- `music/library/` — library browsing pages
- `music/player/` — now-playing detail view
- `api/spotify/` — server-side API route handlers (token exchange, proxying)
- `redirect.spotify.tsx` — OAuth callback handler

### State management: PlayerStore

`src/lib/client/player/store/` implements a Redux-like pattern for player state:

- **`player-store.ts`** — `createPlayerStore()` returns `{ state, dispatch, action, listeners }`. All state mutations go through `dispatch(action)`.
- **`player-actions.ts`** — `PlayerActionFactory` creates typed actions (`play`, `pause`, `setSong`, `seek`, `next`, `previous`, `setVolume`, `setRepeat`, `setShuffle`, `setDevice`, `requestSync`, `syncExternalState`)
- **`player-state-updater.ts`** — applies actions to the SolidJS store (via `createStore`)
- **`player-action-listeners.ts`** — `PlayerActionListenerManager` lets adapters subscribe to dispatched actions; `playerActionHandler` is a helper for building typed handler maps

### Spotify adapter

`src/lib/client/player/adapter/spotify-player-adapter.ts` bridges `PlayerStore` actions to Spotify APIs:

- Registers as a listener on `playerStore.listeners`
- Routes actions to either the **Spotify REST API** (remote devices) or the **Spotify Web Playback SDK** (local in-browser player), depending on `state.device`
- `getSpotifyPlayerState()` fetches and normalizes current Spotify playback into `PlayerState`
- The Web Playback SDK is lazily initialised when the user selects the local device

### Contexts

- **`AuthContext`** (`src/lib/client/auth-context.ts`) — provided at root; manages `SpotifyAuth` token lifecycle
- **`MusicContext`** (`src/lib/client/music-context.ts`) — provided in `music.tsx`; bundles `playerStore` and typed Spotify API accessors (`albums`, `artists`, `player`, `playlists`, `tracks`)

Use `useMusicContext()` / `useAuthContext()` inside components.

### Spotify API client

`spotify-api-client/` is a local package generated from Spotify's OpenAPI spec. To regenerate:

```bash
bun run spotify-api-client:update    # re-download spec
bun run spotify-api-client:generate  # regenerate client code
```

Import from `"spotify-api-client"` — path alias `~/*` maps to `./src/*`.

### Server/client split

- `src/lib/server/` — server-only code (session management, direct Spotify data fetching)
- `src/lib/client/` — browser code (contexts, player store, auth)
- API routes in `src/routes/api/` run server-side and are the boundary between the two

### Styling

Pure CSS modules in `src/styles/`. The skeuomorphic iOS 6 aesthetic is the point — prefer CSS over component libraries. Biome enforces double quotes and space indentation.
