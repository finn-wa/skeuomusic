# skeuomusic

A music player web-app based on the Music app in [iOS 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_6).

This is primarily a fun personal project to mess around with CSS and learn SolidJS.

iOS 6 was the final iteration of Apple's [skeuomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) design system on mobile.
I have fond memories of using it on my first smart device, the [4th generation iPod Touch](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch_(4th_generation)>).

### Tech

- Written in SolidJS with TanStack Router.
- Uses the Spotify API.

### Current State

Works as a janky Spotify library viewer.

### Goals

- Implement the Now Playing view.
- "Play Next" and "Play Last" queueing system. I had this functionality on my jailbroken iPod via [Cyueue](https://cydia.saurik.com/info/com.saurik.cyueue/), but I may decide to use a different UI.
- Add support for local files. I'd support Apple Music if they didn't charge 100 USD for the privilege of using their API.

### Notes

- Useful for reverse-engineering colour opacity: https://codepen.io/quyenvsp/pen/jOLBBmX
